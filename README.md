# Dice Games 

## a scoring app for dice games that can function in real time accross multiple devices

This is a work in progress. Currently I am developing the basic front and backend for Farkle with the scoring stored on an Apollo database. Next I will integrate MongoDB change stream for the real time functionality. And eventually I will make everything work with user accounts and add Yahtzee scoring.




this is a test
